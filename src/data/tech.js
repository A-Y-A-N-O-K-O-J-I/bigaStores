    ---
    
    9. Check for Malware
    
    Malware or unwanted background apps can overwork your phone without your knowledge. Install a trusted antivirus app to scan your phone and remove any harmful software.
    
    
    ---
    
    10. Factory Reset (Last Resort)
    
    If your phone still overheats despite all efforts, and you suspect software issues, consider backing up your data and doing a factory reset. This clears out everything and gives your phone a fresh start.
    
    
    ---
    
    Conclusion
    
    Preventing your phone from overheating is mostly about good habits — avoiding excess heat, managing performance, and using quality accessories. By following these tips, you can extend your phone’s lifespan and keep it running efficiently. Stay cool, and so will your device
